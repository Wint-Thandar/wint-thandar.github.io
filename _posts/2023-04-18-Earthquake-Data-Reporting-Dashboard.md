To view the data better, you can hide the filters by clicking the cross button. You can view the filters again by clicking on the same button. There are three dashboards created for data analysis, you can view each one by clicking on the respective tab. The filters are shared between all dashboards. So, the filtered values will be active for all the dashboards. The filter icon on the right side of the filter name can be used to clear the filter and show all the values. The down arrow icon on the right side of the filter icon can be used to select whether to include or exclude the selected data of that filter from the dashboard.

At the bottom right of the dashboard, you can see a share icon and a download icon. Share button can be used to get a sharable link of the dashboard. Download button can be used to download the file as an image, PDF, or PowerPoint file. If viewing the embed dashboard is too small, you can click on the Tableau logo at the bottom left of the dashboard. That will open the dashboard in a new tab. The advantage of that is that you can use the full screen feature by clicking on the full screen icon at the bottom right of the dashboard.
